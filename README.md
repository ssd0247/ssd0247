HEY THERE! Shubham this side, Namaste 🙏🙏

> - 👋 Hi, I’m Shubham, *aka ssd0247*
> - 👀 I’m interested in all things data and math !! ***The messier to make sense of, the better it gets!!*** 🤓
> - 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and how it can help me build and run CPU intensive ML/AI algorithms. **{** I'm a little skeptical about the term *"AI"* and it's *"penetration"* in the real world **}**
> - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that contribute towards my main purpose of life, that is to drive us towards fully automated systems. **{** which, I think as per my current knowledge, should take help from both `symbolic-AI` and `deep-learning` based approaches **}**
